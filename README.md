# LLM-based-Chatbot-for-data-analysis-and-visualisation
A chatbot that can help data analysts to work with hybrid-built language models to receive  accurate and efficient data  solutions to all their data queries.
The main goal of this program is to investigate the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in the processing of financial data using natural language.
The objectives are to:
1.	Design and implement a modular chatbot capable of interpreting natural language queries.
2.	Develop a backend that leverages LLMs to generate executable Python code for data analysis.
3.	Perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of selected small- and medium-scale language models to determine their effectiveness.
4.	Analyse the trade-offs between model size, performance, cost, and latency.
5.	Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current generation of small and medium sized LLMs for this specific task.
