# LLM-based-Chatbot-for-data-analysis-and-visualisation
A chatbot that can help data analysts to work with hybrid-built language models to receive  accurate and efficient data  solutions to all their data queries.
The main goal of this program is to investigate the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in the processing of financial data using natural language.
The objectives are to:
1.	Design and implement a modular chatbot capable of interpreting natural language queries.
2.	Develop a backend that leverages LLMs to generate executable Python code for data analysis.
3.	Perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of selected small- and medium-scale language models to determine their effectiveness.
4.	Analyse the trade-offs between model size, performance, cost, and latency.
5.	Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current generation of small and medium sized LLMs for this specific task.

# Scope and Delimitations
This study focuses on structured, temporal financial data in the format of .xlsx files, specifically with regards to historical daily stock prices. Data extraction, aggregation, filtering conditionally, computation, and basic visualization comprise the limited set of analytical activities for this study. This study will not involve real-time streaming of data, forecasting modelling, or complex financial modelling practices. A user study will be conducted with a small target population for the purpose of gathering qualitative observations rather than statistically significant demographic details. These short-listed LLMs represent a sampling but not the complete set of existing models.
